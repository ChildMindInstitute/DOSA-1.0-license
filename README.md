Though it is not itself an open source license, the purpose of this Delayed Open Source Attribution License 
(the "DOSA License") is to provide open access to software for non-commercial use while giving attribution to its original developer, 
and after a delay of three years, forcing the software to fall under the terms of the open source CPAL-1.0 license 
(located at https://opensource.org/licenses/CPAL-1.0) or a future version of the CPAL-1.0 license published by Socialtext, Inc. (the "CPAL License") 
that preserves the attribution information of this DOSA License. This delay is intended to protect the commercial interests of the licensor 
without compromising on the many benefits of creating open source products.
